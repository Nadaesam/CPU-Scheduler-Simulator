Simulating CPU schedule algorithms (With solving starvation)

• Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling with context switching.                                                                                   
• Non-Preemptive Shortest- Job First (SJF).                                                                                                    
• Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF).                                                                                                        
• AGAT Scheduling. each process has its own quantum (different from the others).
